# Serious Game

The objective of this assignment was to implement a serious game. A serious game aims to teach or train the user to help or solve a societal issue.

The game I made for this assignment encourages the user to clean up the area around them. The player begins by walking down a street that is lined with rubbish. The goal of the game is to pick up the rubbish items and place them in the bins provided. Every time the player deposits an item into the bin, their score will increase. 

### Required Game Elements

1. A Story: The game should have a plot/theme.
2. Gamification: There should be clear instructions on how to play the game, how to win/lose and how to gather points.
3. Feedback: The player should be updated on their progress.
4. Simulated using OpenGL: The game should consist of a virutal interactive scene.
5. Be Useful: Teach or train about a societal issue.

### Required OpenGL Elements

1. Display a 3D mesh.
2. Allow interaction within the game through the keyboard/mouse.
3. Include at least one complex hierarchical structure with ongoing transformations.
4. Lit and shaded including diffuse and specular objects.
5. Support at least 2 different camera views (eg. first person and overhead).

C/C++ and OpenGL have been used for this assignment.
